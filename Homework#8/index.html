        <p>Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for environment setup<br />instructions, they've moved to <span class="underlined">their own section</span>. Continue reading for an introduction to the<br />documentation, Native Components, React, and more!</p>

        <h2>core components<span>Chapter 2</span></h2>
        <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and<br />the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs<br />APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: <span class="italic">bundles of reusable, nestable code</span>. You can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.</p>

    <section class="chapter-3">
        <h2>react fundamentals<span>Chapter 3</span></h2>
        <p>React Native runs on <span class="underlined">React</span>, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with<br />JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get<br />you started or can serve as a refresher course.</p>
        <p>We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
        <p><span class="bold">+ components.</span> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly,<br />approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so:<br /><span class="code">&lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;.</span></p>
        <p>The React docs have <span class="underlined">a comprehensive guide to JSX</span> you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is<br />JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <span class="code">name</span> for the cat, name, and<br />embedding it with curly braces inside <span class="code">&lt;/Text&gt;</span></p>
        <p><span class="bold">+ props.</span> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù. </p>
        <p><span class="bold">+ state.</span> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components render,<br />state is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over<br />time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!</p>

    <section class="chapter-4">
        <h2>handling text input<span>Chapter 4</span></h2>
        <p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an <span class="italic">onChangeText</span> prop that<br />takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a<br />function to be called when the text is submitted.</p>
        <p>For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different language.<br />In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there<br />Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".</p>
